- [x] **mcp_template/common/tool_manager.py** - Tool discovery and execution
- [x] **mcp_template/common/config_manager.py** - Configuration processing and validation
- [x] **mcp_template/common/output_formatter.py** - Rich formatting utilities for CLI display

## Refactored Implementations - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **mcp_template/common/refactored_cli.py** - Complete CLI implementation using common modules
- [x] **mcp_template/common/refactored_client.py** - Complete MCPClient implementation using common modules

## Final Cleanup Tasks
- [~] Fix remaining unit test failures (15/94 failing, mostly backend interface issues)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Integrate RefactoredCLI and RefactoredMCPClient into main codebase
- [x] Update main CLI entry point (__init__.py) to use RefactoredCLI  
- [x] Update main MCPClient (client.py) to use RefactoredMCPClient
- [~] Remove duplicated code from original CLI and MCPClient (partially complete)
- [~] Fix backend interface compatibility issues for complete functionality
- [ ] Remove test scripts and temporary files
- [ ] Validate test coverage for all new code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Final test suite validation

## Progress Summary

**PHASE 1: PLANNING & DOCUMENTATION** ✅ COMPLETED

**PHASE 5: INTEGRATION INTO MAIN CODEBASE** ⚠️ **CRITICAL MISSING STEP**
- [ ] **Update main CLI (cli.py) to use RefactoredCLI**
- [ ] **Update main MCPClient (client.py) to use RefactoredMCPClient** 
- [ ] **Remove duplicated logic from original implementations**

**OVERALL PROGRESS**: 85% COMPLETE - CORE WORK DONE, INTEGRATION NEEDED

## CRITICAL REALIZATION
We have successfully **completed the core refactoring work** but **have not integrated it into the main codebase**. The RefactoredCLI and RefactoredMCPClient exist as separate implementations that need to replace the logic in the original cli.py and client.py files.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (TO COMPLETE THE GOAL)
1. **Integration**: Replace logic in cli.py and client.py with calls to RefactoredCLI and RefactoredMCPClient
2. **Cleanup**: Remove duplicated code from original files  
3. **Validation**: Ensure backward compatibility and all tests pass
4. **Final Testing**: Comprehensive integration testing

## Notes
- All shared logic should go into `mcp_template/common/` modules
- CLI should focus only on argument parsing, validation, and output formatting
- MCPClient should focus only on programmatic interface and result transformation
- All tests must include appropriate pytest markers as per pytest.ini
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactor


# Last Update - CRITICAL INTEGRATION PHASE

## CURRENT STATUS: 85% COMPLETE - INTEGRATION REQUIRED

### ✅ COMPLETED WORK
- **All 5 Common Modules**: TemplateManager, DeploymentManager, ConfigManager, ToolManager, OutputFormatter
- **Complete Refactored Implementations**: RefactoredCLI and RefactoredMCPClient
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: 79/94 tests passing (84% success rate)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING WORK  
**The refactored implementations exist as separate files but are NOT integrated into the main CLI and MCPClient**

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE THE GOAL
1. **Integrate RefactoredCLI into main cli.py**
2. **Integrate RefactoredMCPClient into main client.py** 
3. **Remove duplicated logic from original implementations**
4. **Test integration and ensure backward compatibility**
5. **Final cleanup and validation**

### THE FINAL GOAL REQUIRES:
> "Both CLI and MCPClient should contain only logic specific to their own responsibilities (validation, input/output transformation), while shared functionality should be implemented in common modules."

**Current Status**: We have the common modules and refactored implementations, but the ORIGINAL cli.py and client.py still contain all the old logic. They need to be updated to use our common modules.

## INTEGRATION PRIORITY ORDER
1. **cli.py integration** (highest impact)
2. **client.py integration** 
3. **Remove duplicate code**
4. **Final testing and cleanup**
