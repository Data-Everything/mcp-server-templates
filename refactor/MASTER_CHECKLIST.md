## Common Modules to Create
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/** - Common shared functionality directory
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/template_manager.py** - Template operations
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/server_manager.py** - Server lifecycle management
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/tool_manager.py** - Tool discovery and execution
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/config_manager.py** - Configuration processing
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/deployment_manager.py** - Deployment operations
- [ ] **mcp_template/common/output_formatter.py** - Output formatting utilities

## Final Cleanup Tasks
- [ ] Remove test scripts and temporary files
- [ ] Remove unused/redundant code
- [ ] Validate test coverage for all new code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Final test suite validation

## Progress Summary

**PHASE 1: PLANNING & DOCUMENTATION** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Foundation)
- ‚úÖ Master checklist created (16 commands identified)
- ‚úÖ Command analysis methodology established
- üîÑ Individual command documentation (3/16 completed: list, deploy, list_tools)

**PHASE 2: COMMON MODULE IMPLEMENTATION** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Common module directory structure created (`mcp_template/common/`)
- ‚úÖ TemplateManager implemented and tested (template discovery, validation, search)
- ‚úÖ DeploymentManager implemented and tested (deployment lifecycle, logs, cleanup)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è ConfigManager (configuration processing and merging)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è ToolManager (tool discovery and management)

**PHASE 3: CLI REFACTORING** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

**PHASE 4: MCPCLIENT REFACTORING** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

**PHASE 5: TESTING & VALIDATION** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

**DETAILED PROGRESS**:
- **Total Commands**: 16
- **Documented**: 3 (list, deploy, list_tools)
- **Common Modules Created**: 2 (TemplateManager, DeploymentManager)
- **Commands Ready for Refactor**: 2 (list, deploy - demo implemented)
- **Commands Refactored**: 2 (list, deploy)

## Notes
- All shared logic should go into `mcp_template/common/` modules
- CLI should focus only on argument parsing, validation, and output formatting
- MCPClient should focus only on programmatic interface and result transformation
- All tests must include appropriate pytest markers as per pytest.ini
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactor
